# parser_tmalign.py
This Python script parses the output of a protein structure alignment tool called `TM-align` and extracts the aligned residues and their distance scores.
The output is printed to the console in a tab-separated format.

## Usage
* Save the output of a `TM-align` run to a text file (e.g., `output_tmalign.txt`).

* Run the script with the following command:
```python
python parse_tmalign_output.py output_tmalign.txt
```
