# plot_ppi.R
This code generates a barplot using the `ggplot2` package in R. The data for the plot is read in from a file named plot.txt, which is a tab-separated file with headers. The first two lines of the code load the necessary libraries: `RColorBrewer` and `ggplot2`.

The `brewer.pal()` function is used to generate a color palette for the plot. In this case, the Dark2 palette is used with 6 colors. The `read.table()` function is then used to read in the data from the file plot.txt.

The `ggplot()` function is used to create the plot. The `aes()` function is used to specify the x and y variables, as well as the fill variable (which is used to color the bars based on the value of the Code column). The `geom_bar()` function is used to create the bars. The `facet_wrap()` function is used to split the plot into multiple panels based on the value of the `Code` column.

The `ggtitle()` function is used to add a title to the plot. The `theme_bw()` function is used to set the theme to a black and white color scheme. The panel.grid.major and panel.grid.minor arguments in the `theme()` function are used to remove the grid lines from the plot. The axis.text.x argument in the `theme()` function is used to rotate the x-axis labels by 45 degrees.

The `scale_fill_manual()` function is used to set the colors for the legend. The values argument is a vector of colors, with the names of the colors corresponding to the names of the factors in the `Code` column.

Finally, the `svg()` function is used to save the plot as an SVG file named barplot_PPIs.svg. The width and height arguments are used to set the dimensions of the plot in inches. The `dev.off()` function is used to close the device used for plotting (in this case, an SVG device).
