# single_line_fasta.py

The code reads a FASTA file and prints out the sequence(s) in it. To use this code, replace `/path/to/file.fasta` with the path to your own FASTA file. This code requires the `Biopython` library to be installed.

# create_multifasta.py
This script combines multiple FASTA files into a single output file named combined.fasta.

To use this script, replace `['file1.fasta', 'file2.fasta', 'file3.fasta']` with a list of the names of the FASTA files you want to combine, and run the script. The output file `combined.fasta` will be created in the same directory as the script.
If you want to save the output file to a different directory, you can modify the script to specify the full path to the output file.
