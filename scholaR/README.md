This is an R code that utilizes the `scholar` package to access and analyze Google Scholar data of a particular author. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

The code starts by loading the required libraries, `scholar` and `ggplot2`.
Then, the author's ID is defined using their Google Scholar profile ID.
* The `get_profile()` function is used to retrieve the author's profile information, and the author's name is printed.
* The `get_citation_history()` function is used to retrieve the author's citation history data for each year, which is then plotted using `ggplot2`.
* The `get_publications()` function is used to retrieve the author's publications data, which is stored in a data frame.
* The `predict_h_index()` function is used to predict the author's future h-index based on their current h-index and publication history. The predicted h-index for each year ahead is plotted using `ggplot2`.

- Note: `scholar` package is no longer available on CRAN (as of March 2023), but it can still be installed from GitHub using the `devtools` package.
