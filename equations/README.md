# sympy.py

The code above demonstrates the use of the Python package `SymPy` for performing symbolic mathematics, including solving equations, finding roots, factorizing equations, finding derivatives, and integrating equations.
The code starts by defining variables `x`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and then defining a quadratic equation `y = a*x**2+b*x+c` with the solve function used to find its roots.
The code then assigns values to `a`, `b`, and `c` and uses the solve function again to find the roots of the quadratic equation with the assigned values.

Next, the code defines two equations with two variables, `x` and `y`, and solves them using the `solve` function.
After that, the code defines a cubic equation, finds its roots, factorizes it, finds its derivative, and integrates it.
Finally, the code plots the cubic equation using the `plot` function from SymPy's `plotting` module.
